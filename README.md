Tools for modifying and styling OpenStreetMap on Garmin for specialist uses

If you use OSM on Garmin it might not suit your particular use. By providing generic
styling tools the utility is increased greatly. The usual workflow is:
* Extract an area from OpenStreetMap
* Do nothing to the extracted OpenStreetMap data
* Process with mkgmap using a simple style
* Load to Garmin

This provides tools to transform the OpenStreetmap data by:
* Delete information 
* Transform information
* Add in new (possibly private) data

An example is provided to help the CFS and provides custom:
* Transformation (DTA script)
* Styling similar to Emergency Services Map Book. This is not meant to be faithful but
  to provide readers with an example and to encourage experimentation
